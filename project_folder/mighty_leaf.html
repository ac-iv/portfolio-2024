        <h5>Overview of Mirrored Confessional</h5>
        <p><em>Mirrored Confessional</em> is a deeply personal project that explores the intersection of identity, vulnerability, and community within the LGBTQ+ space. Through a series of multimedia installations, the project creates a safe, reflective environment for individuals to confront their truths and share their experiences. The concept revolves around the idea of confession — not in the traditional religious sense, but as a form of emotional release and self-acceptance, fostering connections within a community that thrives on openness and mutual understanding.</p>

        <h5>Details and Development</h5>
        <p>This project was developed through extensive research and collaboration with members of the LGBTQ+ community, ensuring that each element resonates with shared experiences. The central piece is a mirrored booth, where participants can leave anonymous confessions or personal reflections. These are then woven into the broader narrative of the project, highlighting the diversity and commonality of experiences within the community. The booth also features interactive components, such as voice recordings and projections, to deepen the immersive nature of the experience.</p>
        <p>Key elements include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manifesto:</strong> A carefully crafted declaration that sets the tone for the project, outlining the importance of honest self-expression and the power of shared experiences in building community.</li>
            <li><strong>Zine – <em>The Holy Bible of Homosexuality</em>:</strong> A provocative, thought-provoking zine that reimagines religious texts through a queer lens. It challenges traditional narratives and offers an alternative guide to self-acceptance, identity, and love.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Installations:</strong> The booth, equipped with mirrors and projections, allows participants to engage not only with their own reflections but also with the stories of others, creating a continuous dialogue of shared experiences.</li>
        </ul>
